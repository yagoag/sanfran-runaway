[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4d79bf52-b817-416b-b72e-a260e3040a7d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sanfranrunaway/deploys) | [Informações em Português](/README.pt-BR.md)

You are in San Francisco, the city with the highest number of hipsters per square feet in the world. Suddenly, hipsters start to walk on the road you are driving on.

To win this game, you must escape from the hipsters without running them over.

Play it right not at https://sanfranrunaway.netlify.com

## Run locally

To run the game locally, just clone the repository and run

```
yarn start
```

You can also use `npm`, just make sure to delete your `yarn.lock` file, otherwise you might have some complaining.

## Building

To run a local production build you can run `yarn build`, but we also have automated build & deployment using Netlify. It automatically runs on every commit that is pushed to `master`.

To check the deployments, [click here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sanfranrunaway/deploys) or on the build status badge at the top of this Readme.
